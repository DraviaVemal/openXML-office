# Introduction

Repository URL [https://github.com/DraviaVemal/openxml-office](https://github.com/DraviaVemal/OpenXML-Office)

Create Presentation (pptx), Spreadsheet (xlsx) & Word (docx) file with ease.

**A Complete Rewrite in Rust for Seamless Document Creation**\
openxml-office offers a modern, high-performance solution for creating and manipulating Office files (PowerPoint, Excel, and Word) with ease, now written entirely in Rust. This project eliminates the reliance on the OpenXML SDK and provides a developer-centric approach for efficient document creation.

**Stage 1: Cross-Language Support**\
The Rust core crate is complemented by a Rust FFI crate, generating shared libraries (.so, .dll, .dylib) for easy integration with C#, Python, and other languages. Stage 1 is progressing steadily, focusing on core XLSX, PPTX, and DOCX functionalities. The package is available for direct use in C# and Python, while further language support is underway.

**Stage 2: Extending to More Languages**\
Stage 2 of the roadmap will introduce official wrappers for Go, TypeScript, and Java. These wrappers will seamlessly integrate with each languageâ€™s package management system, enabling streamlined development and smooth IDE auto-completion.

**Future-Proof and Efficient**\
The openxml-office library is designed to be efficient, user-friendly, and compatible with Microsoft Office versions 2007 and beyond. Developers can expect a consistent level of functionality across languages, ensuring a smooth workflow with minimal dependencies.
